# rocketnozzlecfdproject
Hi! This is a small project I worked on independently this summer to learn more and play around with different nozzle geometries commonly used in aerospace engineering and rocket design. 

The purpose of this project is to model different types of rocket nozzles in Solidworks and simulate supersonic flow through the nozzle through different altitudes to better understand how flow in a nozzle works. Through this, I gained a valuable introduction to flow simulation, fluid mechanics, and computer-aided design in Soidworks.
